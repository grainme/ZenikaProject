## Features

- Room reservation by time slot.
- Management of meeting types: VC, SPEC, RS, RC.
- Management of equipment required for each meeting type.
- Optimization of room occupancy based on capacity and available equipment.


### Components

1. **Repository, Services, and Controller Pattern:** 
   - Implemented to maintain a clean separation of concerns and ensure modularity.
  
2. **Postman:** 
   - Used for endpoint testing and validation to ensure the API functions as expected.

3. **JUnit:** 
   - Utilized for unit testing to validate individual methods and functionalities of specific classes.

## Note on Testing

Please note that not all methods have been extensively tested as this project serves as a demonstration case. The primary focus was on implementing the core functionalities based on the provided specifications. Further testing and validation would be required for a production-ready application to ensure robustness and reliability.
